## 🚀 What is Prompt Sorcery Studio?

Welcome to **Prompt Sorcery Studio**, the AI-powered sorcery lab that turns your casual, random, or downright weird ideas into polished, strategic, AI-tailored Magic Prompts. Think of it like having an AI-savvy wizard on speed dial. 🧙‍♂️

Whether you’re writing Instagram captions, ad hooks, startup slogans, or philosophical tweets about pizza — this tool will craft a prompt better than your intern (and won’t ask for coffee breaks). ☕

## 🎨 Features

* 🎁 **AI Magic Prompt Generator** using Prompt Sorcerror’s magic prompt formula
* 🧠 **Context & Objective Reasoning Layer** to guess what you *really meant*
* 🔥 **Dual AI Model Selection**: OpenAI GPT-3.5, DeepSeek, or Both
* ✨ **Glass morph UI with modern animations**
* ⌛ Intentional loading spinner (because instant is boring)
* 📝 **Feedback form** so you can tell us how awesome (or terrible) it is
* ☕ **Buy Me a Coffee** link because we love caffeine-fueled coding marathons
